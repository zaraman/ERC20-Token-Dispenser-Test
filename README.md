# ERC20-Token-Dispenser-Test
The ERC20 Token Dispenser contract is designed to distribute a fixed amount of ERC20 tokens over a predefined schedule. This system ensures tokens are distributed monthly without exceeding the maximum specified amount per month. The distribution follows a specific pattern over several years, gradually decreasing until all tokens are distributed.
